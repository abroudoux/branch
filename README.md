# branch

🌿 Enhance Git Branch Management

## 🚀 Installation

### Via Homebrew

Wip 🚧

### Manual

You can paste the binary in your `bin` directory (e.g., on mac it's `/usr/bin/local`). \
Don't forget to grant execution permissions to the binary.

```bash
chmox +x branch
```

## 💻 Usage

`branch` allows you to manage your Git branches with various and commons actions. Once you're in interactive mode, either by using `run` / the `-r` flag or simply by running `branch`, you can manage your branches with basics options, like `Copy the name`, `Checkout`, `Delete`, `Create a new branch from` or `Merge`.

```bash
branch run
```

```bash
Choose a branch:

    develop
    feature/ui
> * main
```

```bash
Branch: name

Choose an action:

  Exit
  Delete
  Merge
  Branch
  Checkout
> Name
```

You can also list all your branches using the `--list` / `-l` flag.

```bash
branch --list
```

If you want to personnalize `branch`, refer to `config.json`
