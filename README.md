🌿 Enhance Git Branch Management

`branch` allows you to manage your Git branches with various and commons actions. Once you're running `branch`, you can manage your branches with basics options, like `Copy the name`, `Checkout`, `Delete`, `Create a new branch from` or `Merge`.

## 🚀 Installation

### Via Homebrew

```bash
brew tap abroudoux/tap
brew install branch
```

You can paste the binary in your `bin` directory (e.g., on MacOS it's `/usr/bin/local`). \
Don't forget to grant execution permissions to the binary.

```

Enjoy!
